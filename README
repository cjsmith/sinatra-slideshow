This is a super simple Sinatra app to present Sinatra to the Vancouver Ruby Meetup.  It requires Ruby 1.9 and uses ultraviolet to render code snippets, and haml to render the slides.

You can use 'n' to advance to the next slide, 'p' to go back to the previous slide and 'i' to get my notes on the slide.
