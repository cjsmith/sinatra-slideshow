notes:

philosophy is start simple

rails generates 72 files, it's now up to over 90 kloc

not MVC.  you can do whatever you want.

CGI programming

abstractions you don't need breed complexity

minimalism breeds simplicity

if rails is painting by numbers, sinatra is starting with a blank slate with some great brushes (with CSS and javasciript to do the colouring and the animation, the way it should be).

no generation

content_type

declarative

json vs xml

rails:
responds_to

sinatra:

get '/users.xml'
  content_type :xml
  @user.to_xml

regexes.  you can write regexes as routes and then use matches to assemble your parameters


use sinatra. 

even better write your own.
