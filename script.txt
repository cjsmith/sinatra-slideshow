Sinatra Speech

who i am

java developer who was introduced to RoR at our former company's Ruby night
been using it for personal projects and the odd script at work ever since

outline
what is sinatra
why sinatra is great

goal. 

not explain every detail of sinatra
there aren't that many, and the they well documented in the readme at sinatrarb.com (first hit when googling sinatra)
also use the source (~1500 lines; far less than Rails/Ramaze/Camping)

what is sinatra? 
written by Blake Miserany (Heroku) in 2007
it's a web micro framework - hello world is 4 lines; you can do an aweful lot in 100 lines
it's DSL for creating web applications in Ruby
it's a minimalists web framework, and this breeds clean design
no boilerplate; makes it much easier to focus on the problem, especially at the early stages of a project
fairly easy to port to rails 



routes in sinatra

rest routes
no classes
verb + uri matcher + block
liberating because you're not trapped in the framework.  feels more like writing ruby than writing rails  
avoid leaky abstraction syndrome

sessions

enable :sessions

views in sinatra

-partials

basically it's

wrappers around RACK request/responses

helpers for status body, redirect, parsing uris, headers, mime types, content types, file upload, download, caching, using templates

templates layout

inline templates

helpers

running sinatra

sinatra vs rails FIGHT!!!

MVC:
REST:
active record/sequel/datamapper integration:
advanced routing: 
speed:
testablilty with steak/cucucumber/rspec/testunit:
access to rails plugins:
RACK webserver integration
LOC 
what its good for
prototyping
do one thing web apps
the perfect framework to make a blog; makes DHH's blog in 10 minutes seem archaic
REST web service apis to existing applications
lightweight backends for sites that use javascript front ends like backbone or sproutcore or even rapheal
making web tools: 
  eg deployment with chef/Net::SSH/capistrano etc
  interfaces over web sites using nogogiri
  prototyping
  simple one function web apps
  playing with ideas

in conclusion, i think that sinatra should be in every software craftsman's toolbox
